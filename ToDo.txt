Organize/separate core+implementations from usage+examples
    Perhaps split up repo to have an examples and a core so it can be easily included in other projects.
Integrate mesh manager with tile system
    Make a renderer that uses mesh manager directly, and provides it with tiles as needed (or passes the bakery to it)
    Make sure the mesh manager does not render areas first so that it can have height data
Make randoms in mesh manager deterministic
Make meshManager async, and optimize it.


output maps file:
specify pixelplacement mode
    pixel centers on tile corners
        kinda like margins .5 and addPixels -1
    pixels fully within tile
    margins (add extra pixels outside tile, like addPixels, but adds coverage area instead of higher resolution)
        interger px added to all sides

fixed pixel size in world space
max/min pixel size in world space


maps:
sample modes:
    exact 1:1
        optional: offset px
    filtered (filtermode)
    
sample settings:
    always cashed
    never cashed
